# odin-font

Work-in-progress font rendering library in Odin. The one and only dependency is OpenGL 4.5.

Contains a pre-baked font file based on consola.ttf with font sizes from 8px to 72 px, in steps of 4px. Shaders are not hard-coded. 

#### NOTE: It is recommended to put this into the shared collection:
```
cd Odin/shared
git clone https://github.com/vassvik/odin-gl_font.git
```
